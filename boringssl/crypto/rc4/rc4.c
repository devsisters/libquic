     * Special notes.
     *
     * - is_endian is declared automatic as doing otherwise
     *   (declaring static) prevents gcc from eliminating
     *   the redundant code;
     * - compilers (those I've tried) don't seem to have
     *   problems eliminating either the operators guarded
     *   by "if (sizeof(RC4_CHUNK)==8)" or the condition
     *   expressions themselves so I've got 'em to replace
     *   corresponding #ifdefs from the previous version;

     *   sizeof(RC4_CHUNK)!=8 be (were also #ifdefed
     *   before);
     * - in case you wonder "&(sizeof(RC4_CHUNK)*8-1)" in
     *   [LB]ESHFT guards against "shift is out of range"
     *   warnings when sizeof(RC4_CHUNK)!=8
