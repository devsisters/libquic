// PacketedBioCreate creates a filter BIO which implements a reliable in-order
// blocking datagram socket. The resulting BIO, on |BIO_read|, may simulate a
// timeout which sets |*out_timeout| to the timeout and fails the read.
// |*out_timeout| must be zero on entry to |BIO_read|; it is an error to not
// apply the timeout before the next |BIO_read|.
//
// Note: The read timeout simulation is intended to be used with the async BIO
// wrapper. It doesn't simulate BIO_CTRL_DGRAM_SET_NEXT_TIMEOUT, used in DTLS's
// blocking mode.
